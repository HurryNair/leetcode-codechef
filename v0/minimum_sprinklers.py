Given an array arr[] consisting of N integers, where the ith element represents the range 
of a sprinkler i.e [i-arr[i], i+arr[i]] it can water, 
the task is to find the minimum number of the sprinkler to be turned on to water every plant 
at the gallery. If it is not possible to water every plant, then print -1.
Note: If arr[i] = -1, then the sprinkler cannot be turned on.
