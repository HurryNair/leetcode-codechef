We being by creating a reverseList method that reverses a linked list. This code is from the leetcode problem "Reversing a Linked List"
We create a method getNumber which gets the number from a linked list.
We reverse l1 and l2 , get their numbers, then add them together.
We create a new linked list with the value of l1_num + l2_num
We reverse l3 and solve the problem!
