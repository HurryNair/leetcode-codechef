- find intersection between 2 arrays
- print common numbers as many times as they occur in common
- order of printing doesnt matter

- use a hashmap to count number of occurences of each value
- do this for both arrays
- check if the 2 maps have common keys
- if yes, take min of the 2 vlaues of the 2 keys and add that key those many times to a result array
- return result
