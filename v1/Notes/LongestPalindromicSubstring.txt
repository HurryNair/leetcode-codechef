- Brute Force
Generate all substrings
Check if they are palindromes
Keep track of the longest one that passes above condition and return

- Optimized solution
Consider each element is the center of the longest palindrome string
Extend leftwards and rightwards as long as left element == right element
Take into account that palindromes can have both odd number of chars as well as even & handle them individually
Return the max of all

- Another minor optimization
Copying s[l:r+1] into res can become an O(n) operation altogether taking complexity back to n^3
Keep track of indices instead
